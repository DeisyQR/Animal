      <p>
        I got my childhood dog when I was around 11 years old, and he has been with me through all of life’s milestones—from high school to college. He's been my best friend and constant companion for 9 years, and I’ve taken him everywhere I've gone.

      <p>
        My dog brings me happiness, joy, and a sense of belonging. He’s been there for countless memorable moments—my first sports matches, graduation, and every quiet evening in between. The bond we share is unbreakable.

      <p>
        Dogs are loyal, loving, and emotionally in tune with their humans. Many people see their pets as family—and rightly so. Their companionship, empathy, and unconditional love are unlike anything else. They aren’t just animals; they’re our kids, our protectors, and our best friends.
